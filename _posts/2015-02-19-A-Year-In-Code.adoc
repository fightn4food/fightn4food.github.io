= A Year In Code

Well, I've seen a lot of other insipring stories about people learning code in a year, so I thought I'd give it a shot. 
I love the idea of rapid creation, nothing excites me more than trying out new ideas. So with that, I'll keep you updated on my coding progess throughout the year. With any luck, I'll have made some cool things and learned a valuable skill... or done nothing but procrastinate... we'll see how it goes.
